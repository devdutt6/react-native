# Learning React Native

With React Native we can create **Android, IOS mobile applications** and also **web applications** in one go. 
Benefit of learning react-native is that I already have experinece with react and react-native follows same coding style as react 
so it will be easier to learn and I can hop into mobile development and can get to know the in and out of the mobile application development.

This repository has all the react-native projects that I have made/worked on while learning React Native.

To learn React Native I have followed [**Codevolution**](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution)'s 
react-native tutorial on [**youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhiQJD1di4eRVN30WWCXkg1).
